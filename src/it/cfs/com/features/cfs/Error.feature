    As a software developer
    I need to retrieve  errors and their description  repported by application
    # @wip
    #Scenario: Get an error descrption
    #    Given I have an error <errorID> 
    #  And I have set <action>
    #	 When I request corresponding description
    #	 Then The description should be <desc>


    #Examples:
